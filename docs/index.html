        <h1><a id="overview"></a>Overview</h1>
     
    <p><img src="_images/doc_Overview.jpg" alt="aweCP" width="138" height="414" class="docImage">
          aweControlPicker is a GUI Picker tool for Autodesk Maya that enables animators to define a bunch of buttons to select
          specific objects (e.g. controllers) in their scene.
          It works much like Character Selection GUIs you've most likely used before, except it's designed to be as minimalistic as
        possible, can be edited on the fly, works with any rig and provides ease of access to maximize the speed of your workflow.<br>
          The main functionality is quite simple: you select one or more objects, add a Picker for the current selection and voil√†!<br>
          Pickers can be labelled, configured to display in one of 12 colors, organized into tabs you create and re-ordered at 
          will. All Pickers and tabs, as well as their order of appearance, are stored with the scene and will be automatically loaded
          whenever you run the script. Additionally, you can save your Picker configuration out to a  file, which can then be
          loaded back into Maya to restore your configuration.
        </p>

        <p>
          The script works by creating an objectSet for each Picker. This Set will hold any
          objects associated with that Picker, enabling the script to work with arbitrary rigs and
          allowing you the flexibility to rename or reparent associated objects without having to worry about breaking the
          respective Picker's functionality.</p>
        <p>
          The following document provides an extensive overview of the script's functionality and explanations for its usage.
            You are encouraged to take a gander, though the daredevils among you may opt to simply ignore my efforts and not 
            RTFM. Suit yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Special thanks to my personal Lab-Rat aka Alpha-Tester <a href="http://www.animitt.com/" target="_blank">David Nilsson</a> for his valuable input throughout the development of this script.

        <h2>Important information</h2>
        
        <p style="color: #C60000;">
          Do not tamper with the objectSets!
        </p>
        <p>
          As mentioned, the script relies heavily (heck, exclusively!) on the use of objectSets to perform its duties.
          Internally, all Tabs and Pickers are represented by objectSets. Since there is no way to 'hide' objectSets and thus
          prevent their exposure within the DAG, they are susceptible to modification via the User (yes, that's you!).
          Therefore, I'm obliged to give you this warning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any objectSet starting with <span class="code">(namespace:)aweCP_</span>
          is managed and used by the script. If you really, <span class="italic">really</span> need to you can
            group these sets into their own set, but bear in mind that doing so will create more clutter in the case that you
            reference such a scene into another scene.

        <h1><a id="installation"></a>Installation</h1>

        <p>Installing the script is very easy. Just follow these short steps and you'll be up and running in no time.
        </p>
        <p><span class="inum">1</span>Copy the script file <span class="file">aweControlPicker.mel</span> to your scripts directory.<br>
            On Windows, this is located under
          <span class="file">C:\Username\Documents\maya\201x\scripts</span>.
          You can determine the location of your scripts directory from within Maya by executing the following MEL command:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>internalVar -usd;</code>
        </p>
        <p><span class="inum">2</span>
          Copy the PNG images to your icons directory.<br>
            Again, under Windows, this is located under
            <span class="file">C:\Username\Documents\maya\201x\prefs\icons</span>.
          You can determine your icons directory by executing the following command:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>internalVar -ubd;</code>
        </p>
        <p><span class="inum">3</span>
          Now all that needs to be done is initialize the script; do this the first time you install the script and whenever you update the file in the future. Start Maya if it wasn't already running and execute the following MEL command:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>source "aweControlPicker.mel";</code>
        </p>
        <p><span class="inum">4</span>
          To start using the script, you execute the following command (I recommend creating a shelfbutton for convenience):
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>aweControlPicker;</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I've supplied an image called <span class="file">aweControlPicker.png</span> 
            <img src="_images/aweControlPicker.png" width="32" height="32" alt="aweControlPicker"> 
            that you can use as an icon for your shelfbutton (or not, I mean, that's like, uh, totally up to you).
        </p>
        <p>
          That's it! Enoy using the script!<br>
          Oh, by the way, there are instructions on setting up the awesome <span class="hilite">aweControlPicker MarkingMenu</span> of Awesomeness
          which you can find <a href="#markingmenu" title="MarkingMenu">here</a>, but don't get ahead of yourself!

      <div class="section">
        <h1><a id="usage"></a>Using the Script</h1>

        <p>
          This section explains how to use the script and what the main functions are. While I designed the UI to be as intuitive as possible,
          it may be helpful to read up on what's possible with it (would you have guessed that you can drag Pickers around and merge them?)

          To add a Picker button, first select one or more objects, then hit the
          <img src="_images/cpAdd.png" width="34" height="25" alt="PICKR+">
          button (If nothing is selected, that button will be disabled, since you can't explicitly create "empty" buttons). 
          You will be prompted to add a label for your button and set its color. The resulting Picker will be
          added to the bottom of the currently active tab.<br>
          You can add as many Pickers per tab as you like (well, up to 999, but... why?).
        </p>
        <p>
          Right-clicking a Picker displays a Popup Menu that allows you to edit a Picker in the following ways:

          The script doesn't distinguish, nor does it care, what type of object you add to the
          selection list of a Picker. As long as it's a valid DAG object, you can create a Picker for
          it. This makes the script useful not only for selecting animation controls, but virtually
          any other node you want quick access to, e.g. shaders, constraints, geometry, polygon unicorns, etc.
        </p>

        <h2><a id="pickerfunctions"></a>Picker functions and key modifiers</h2>

        <p>
          To select objects associated with a particular Picker, simply click it (Yes, it's that easy!).
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like the viewport, holding down <img src="_images/shift.png" width="44" height="19" alt="shift"> while 
          clicking a Picker will toggle the associated objects' selected state. You can use this modifier to quickly 
          make 'interim' selection groups, for example by quickly 'subtracting' (toggling) the left wrist from the whole arm group, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you hold <img src="_images/alt.png" width="33" height="19" alt="alt"> while clicking a Picker, the script 
          will attempt to apply the Prefix entered in the <span class="hilite">Prefix Editor</span> on the objects 
          associated with that Picker and select the prefixed objects instead. See the <a href="#prefixes" title="Prefixes">
            Prefixes</a> section below to find out more about how prefixing works in this script.

        <h2><a id="modifiers"></a>Manipulating Pickers</h2>

        <p>
          Pickers can be manipulated in a variety of ways by using the middle-mouse button and dragging them onto other Pickers:
        </p>
        <p>
          To <span class="hilite">move</span> a Picker to a new position in the list, simply middle-mouse 
          <span class="hilite">drag</span> (<img src="_images/middlemouse.png" width="16" height="16" alt="mmb">) 
          it onto another Picker. Let go on the upper half of a Picker to insert the dragged Picker before, 
          or on the lower half to insert after it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wish to <span class="hilite">merge</span> the selection list of two buttons, hold down 
          <img src="_images/shift.png" width="44" height="19" alt="shift"> and middle-mouse <span class="hilite">drag</span> 
          (<img src="_images/middlemouse.png" width="16" height="16" alt="mmb">) Picker A on to Picker B. Picker A will 
          be deleted (!) and Picker B will now additionally select the objects formerly associated with Picker A.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wish to create a new Picker <span class="hilite">combining</span> the selection lists of two other 
          Pickers, hold down <img src="_images/ctrl.png" width="33" height="19" alt="ctrl"> and middle-mouse 
          <span class="hilite">drag</span> (<img src="_images/middlemouse.png" width="16" height="16" alt="mmb">) 
          one Picker on to the other. A new Picker is created and the original Pickers are preserved (at least until the polygon unicorn gets hungry...).

        <p>
          <img src="_images/doc_PrefixEditor.jpg" alt="Prefix Editor" width="216" height="185" class="docImage">
          The script offers a limited form of Prefix matching for your selections to
          enable you to switch between Rigs in your scene without having to create new Pickers for each one. Using namespaces is probably the smartest
          way to go about using two identical Rigs in the same scene but the script tries to cover
          the most common ‚Äì however simple ‚Äì scenarios. To use a Prefix on a Picker you simply hold
          <img src="_images/alt.png" width="33" height="19" alt="alt"> while clicking it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, there are three Prefix modes available: <span class="hilite">Prefix</span>,
          <span class="hilite">Hierarchy</span> and <span class="hilite">Namespace</span>.<br>
          All modes require you to input some string in the respective text field located in the
          <span class="hilite">Prefix Editor</span> (if you can't see the Prefix Editor, make sure it
          is enabled under <img src="_images/cpOptions.png" width="29" height="25" alt="Options">
          <span class="option">UI Display</span>).<br>
          See the following sections for a rundown on how to use the various modes available.
         </p>

        <h3>Prefix</h3>

        <p>
          This is the most straightforward of the Prefix modes. It works by replacing a string of characters you 
          provide with a different set of characters on the objects associated with a Picker.<br>
          This requires you to enter two sets of strings: the current Prefix on the objects actually
          associated with a Picker, and an alternative Prefix which you'd like to use instead to
          identify a different set of objects. The script will <span class="italic">replace the current prefix
          with the alternate prefix</span> on every object and try to select it. If that fails, it will try to replace 
            the prefixes on every node in each object's hierarchy in an attempt to find it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's an example:<br>
          Say you imported the rig 'Blob' twice into your scene. Instead of using a namespace in the Import dialog you chose to use a 
          string prefix (how naughty!) to resolve name-clashes ‚Äì
          each time using a different prefix, e.g. 'Boy' and 'Girl'. Your rigs in Maya may look something like this:
        </p>

        <div class="clearfix">
          <div class="hierarchy">
            BoyBlob<br>
            |--- BoyHeadControls<br>
            |----|--- BoyFaceControls<br>
            |----|----|--- BoyEyeControl
          </div>

          <div class="hierarchy">
            GirlBlob<br>
            |--- GirlHeadControls<br>
            |----|--- GirlFaceControls<br>
            |----|----|--- GirlEyeControl
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          If you had created a Picker for the object 'BoyEyeControl' and wanted to use the same button to select 
          'GirlEyeControl' instead, you could enter 'Boy' into the current prefix field, and 'Girl' into the 
          alternate prefix field. <img src="_images/alt.png" width="33" height="19" alt="alt">-clicking the Picker 
          would now select 'GirlEyeControl'.
        </p>
        <p style="clear: left">
          Summary: Enter current and replacement prefixes into the respective textfields.
        </p>

        <h3>Hierarchy</h3>

        <p>
          In this mode, you can switch the Picker's selection to work between multiple rigs that
          are <span class="italic">absolutely identical except for the top-most node</span> in the hierarchy. Let's try to
          exemplify this:<br>
          Say you have a rig "CharacterA" in your scene and you've created a Picker for "EyeControl".
          If you duplicate the rig, Maya creates "CharacterA1", which you then rename to "CharacterB"
          (because you're a diligent person and you fear flesh-eating polygon unicorns). Here are the two rig hierarchies:
        </p>

        <div class="clearfix">
          <div class="hierarchy">
            CharacterA<br>
            |--- HeadControls<br>
            |----|--- FaceControls<br>
            |----|----|--- EyeControl
          </div>

          <div class="hierarchy">
            CharacterB<br>
            |--- HeadControls<br>
            |----|--- FaceControls<br>
            |----|----|--- EyeControl
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          As you see, the rigs/hierarchies are identical except for the name of the top-most node. If you enable <span class="hilite">Hierarchy</span> mode, 
          you could enter "CharacterB" in the Prefix field. Now <img src="_images/alt.png" width="33" height="19" alt="alt">-
          clicking the Picker will select the EyeControl under CharacterB instead of CharacterA.
        </p>

        <p>
          Summary: Enter the name of the top-most node of the rig/hierarchy you want to use alternatively.
        </p>

        <h3>Namespace</h3>

        <p>
          In this mode, the script will try to <span class="italic">switch between the namespaces of objects</span>
          as you define them, provided their <span class="italic">DAG hierarchies are otherwise identical</span>
            (i.e. differ only in namespace). This is very similar to the <span class="hilite">Prefix</span> mode, except it
          is designed to work with Maya's namespace feature as opposed to arbitrarily defined prefixes.<br>
          For example, you could create a Picker for an object inside the namespace "BoyRig" and
          switch to the same object in the namespace "GirlRig", independent of the namespace the
          object actually resides in (which in this case would be BoyRig).<br>
          Let's use the example hierarchy above for clarification (but modified with namespaces):
        </p>

        <div class="clearfix">
          <div class="hierarchy">
            BoyRig:Rig<br>
            |--- BoyRig:HeadControls<br>
            |----|--- BoyRig:FaceControls<br>
            |----|----|--- BoyRig:EyeControl
          </div>

          <div class="hierarchy">
            GirlRig:Rig<br>
            |--- GirlRig:HeadControls<br>
            |----|--- GirlRig:FaceControls<br>
            |----|----|--- GirlRig:EyeControl<br>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          If you had created a Picker for the object "BoyRig:EyeControl", but wanted to use it to select 
          "GirlRig:EyeControl" instead, you can set Prefix Mode to <span class="hilite">Namespace</span> and enter "GirlRig" (without the colon and quotation marks!)
          into the Prefix field. <img src="_images/alt.png" width="33" height="19" alt="alt">-clicking the Picker will 
          now select "GirlRig:EyeControl".<br>
          By the way, this also works if an object you alternatively want to select is in the "root" namespace 
          (identified in the outliner by not having any "namespace:" prefix). In that case, simply leave the prefix field blank.
        </p>

        <p>
          Summary: Enter the namespace of the object you want to use alternatively, ommitting the ":" (colon).
        </p>

        <h2><a id="markingmenu"></a>MarkingMenu</h2>

        <p>
          <img src="_images/doc_MarkingMenu.jpg" alt="Marking Menu" width="216" height="173" class="docImage">
          The script provides an optional Marking Menu that you can use. It enables you to popup a menu inside the 
          viewport (amongst other panels) listing all the existing Pickers right at your mouse cursor.<br>
          The Marking Menu has the advantage that it doesn't require the main user interface to be visible, taking 
          up less screen real estate, while simultaneously offering the most efficient way (in terms of mouse movement)
          to access your Pickers.
         </p>
        <p>
          To make use of the MarkingMenu, you will need to follow these steps:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Find a free hotkey, i.e. one that has neither its 'press' nor 'release' state assigned</li>
          <li>Under <span class="option">Window</span><span class="option">Settings/Preferences <img src="_images/rightarrow.png"></span><span class="option">Hotkey Editor</span>, create a new hotkey<br></li>
          <li>
            Assign the following command to this hotkey's <span class="hilite">press</span> state:<br>
            <code>if(`exists aweCPBuildMM`) aweCPBuildMM();</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a second hotkey for the <span class="italic">same</span> key, but
            this time for its <span class="hilite">release</span> state<br>
          </li>
          <li>
            Assign the following command to this second hotkey:<br>
            <code>if(`exists aweCPDeleteMM`) aweCPDeleteMM();</code>
          </li>
          <li>Save!</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Now that your hotkeys are set up, hover the mouse over the viewport, hold down your new hotkey and the 
          left mouse button (in that order: Hotkey + <img src="_images/leftmouse.png" width="16" height="16" alt="LMB">). 
            A menu will appear listing all your Pickers. Move the mouse over the menu item of your choice and release 
            the mouse button.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case you have more than one Tab set up for your Pickers, the MarkingMenu provides alternative functionality
          (see the <a href="#mmOptions" title="MarkingMenu Options">MarkingMenu Options</a> for details).
        </p>
        <p>

          <span class="hilite">Append</span>, on the other hand, will do just that: append the Tabs and Pickers 
          in the loaded file to the existing ones.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
          <span class="hilite"><strong>Note</strong></span>:<br>
          Because Tab labels must always be unique, appending a file that contains a tab with a label
          that already exists will automatically add a number to the end of the loaded tab's label,
          making it unique (e.g. 'Pickers' becomes 'Pickers1').
        </p>

        <p class="note">
          <span class="hilite"><strong>Note</strong></span>:<br>
          Every object associated with a Picker is saved as a string identifying its absolute
          DAG-path in the scene hierarchy. When loading a .cpf file, the script attempts to find each
          object in the current scene and re-associate it with the Picker. If the object does not
          exist in the current scene (or has been renamed, or reparented, etc.), the association will
          fail and the Picker button will no longer select that object. You will be notified if any
          such issues occured during loading.<br>
          That said, if you find you have such an issue with your .CPF file and the solution would be to simply prefix 
          every object in the file, then you can open the .cpf file in any text editor and apply those 
          changes there before loading it in Maya. Beware not to mess up the document structure though or the script, 
          awesome as it may be, won't be able to correctly parse it.

        <h2><a id="mmOptions"></a>MarkingMenu</h2>

        <p>
          <img src="_images/doc_OptionsMM.jpg" alt="MarkingMenu Options" width="216" height="183" class="docImage">
          In the <span class="option">MarkingMenu</span> submenu of the Options, you can set how the MarkingMenu 
          works and where it shall appear.
        </p>
        <p>You can select between the following two modes:</p>
        <p>
          <span class="option"><img src="_images/radiobutton.png"> Show only current tab</span><br>
          This is the default mode. The MarkingMenu will act like it does when there is only one Tab present: it
          will display a single list of Pickers according to the tab that is currently active in the
          UI. To access Pickers from a different tab, you will have to switch to that tab first.<br>
          This mode allows for the fastest access to a specific subset (tab) of Pickers you want to work with.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="option"><img src="_images/radiobutton.png"> Show all tabs</span><br>
          In this mode, the MarkingMenu will show a list of submenus, one for each existing tab. To
          access the Pickers of a tab, hover over the name of that tab to display its contents, and
          select a Picker from the list.<br>
          This mode grants you access to all Pickers in all tabs, however it requires two 'steps' to
          access any single Picker (show MarkingMenu, show Submenu).
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, you can specify in which <span class="hilite">Panels</span> you want the
          MarkingMenu to appear. Simply select or deselect a panel in the menu to enable or disable
          the MarkingMenu in that panel. Currently available panels include the Viewport, the
          Outliner, the Graph Editor and the Hypershade.
        </p>
 
        <h2><a id="uidisplay"></a>UI Display</h2>

        <p>
          <img src="_images/doc_OptionsUI.jpg" alt="UI Options" width="216" height="183" class="docImage">
          Since the script is designed to offer the most minimalistic interface, it offers
          the options to hide and style certain UI elements via the <span class="option">UI Display <img src="_images/rightarrow.png"></span> menu:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="option">Display Shaded Pickers</span><br>
          You can choose whether you prefer your Pickers to look 'cool' and 'awesome' and whatnot by
          displaying them as 'shaded', which simply adds a little graphic overlay and a fake drop
          shadow effect to them. The alternative is boring, flat buttons.<br>
          Note that when this option is enabled the Picker's label will be left-aligned; when disabled, it will be centered.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="option">Show Prefix Editor</span><br>
          If you find you don't need the Prefix Editor (or you're done using it), you can hide it to
          free up some space. It is visible by default, just so you know it exists ;-)
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="option">Show Tab labels</span><br>
          You can show or hide the tab labels to further maximize the space available for Picker
          buttons. Note that changing this setting modifies the behavior of the two buttons (<span class="option"> ¬´ </span> <span class="option"> ¬ª </span>) above the Picker list:<br>
          When Tab Labels are set to be visible, the buttons act as a way to rearrange Tabs in the layout; 
          you can move the currently active tab left or right (the script attempts to store and retrieve this position 
          information within the configuration, so the next time you load the UI, the tab order will be remembered).<br>
          When Tab Labels are set to be hidden, the buttons act as a means for you to cycle between Tabs (which would 
          otherwise be impossible); pressing the buttons no longer changes the position of Tabs within the layout, but instead simply displays the next/previous tab.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="option">Hilite Pickers</span><br>
          This option enables Picker highlighting and is enabled by default. What it does is monitor your current selection 
          and add a bright background to Pickers that have matching objects in their sets.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          <span class="hilite"><strong>Note</strong></span>:<br>
          This feature is as of yet still in 'experimental' state. Because there is no in-built way to monitor the 
          connection between an interactive UI element (such as the button) and a DAG object, the script has to perform a 
          complete check for all objects and Pickers whenever you change the selection. While this 
          <span class="italic">shouldn't</span> impact performance in a noticeable way (internal tests with heavy data structures revealed &lt; 20ms calculation times), it has the 
          <span class="italic">potential to</span>, especially if you have created a very large set of Pickers or are selecting 
          many objects at once (define 'many': anything more than a few hundred). If you experience performance issues, particulary
            <span class="italic">selection lag</span> while using this feature, simply uncheck the option and see whether that was the cause.
            <span class="italic">("To his face they called him 'Awesome', yet behind his back they whispered, 'Fearmonger'")</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="option">Resize UI for Tabs</span><br>
          This option toggles an automatic behavior that makes the UI resize every time you create,
          delete or rename a tab (as well as when this happens internally via the load and
          re-initialize functions). By doing this, the script tries to ensure that all tabs fit and
          are visible within the width of the UI without having to scroll horizontally.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          <span class="hilite"><strong>Note</strong></span>:<br>
          As there is no practical way for the script to actually measure the width of every tab and
          resize accordingly, it tries to guess an appropriate width. This results in a more or less
          accurate resizing, however it is still merely an educated guess.
          Disable this option if you don't want the UI to jump in size whenever you modify tabs.
        </p>

        <h2><a id="setkeyoptions"></a>Set Key Options</h2>

        <p>
          The options found in this menu dictate the behaviour of Pickers when you use them to key their associated objects (i.e. when you
          ctrl-click them). Because, based on these options, some objects may get keyed while others may not, it is important to understand the different settings and how they affect the keying functionality of the script.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="option"><img src="_images/radiobutton.png"> Key all objects</span><br>
          This is the default setting. Choose this option to key every object in the Picker's objectlist, regardless whether it already has any keys set (i.e. is animated).
          This is the default behaviour since it is probably what most users would expect to happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="option"><img src="_images/radiobutton.png"> Key animated objects</span><br>
          Choose this option if you only want keys to be set on objects that already have keys (i.e. are animated). Objects without any animation
          will remain unkeyed. This option helps keep your scene clean without adding unnecessary animation curves and allows you to manually define
          what objects will be keyed when you use this functionality.<br>
          Choosing this option enables the next option to be set.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="option">Animated Channels only</span><br>
          Checking this option modifies how the above setting works when set to 'Key animated objects'. If checked, keys will only bet set on attributes that are already animated; any other attribute will be left untouched. For example, if an object belonging to this Picker had
          animation on the translation channels, but <span class="italic">not</span> on the rotation channels, then keys will only bet set on the translation attributes.<br>
          Note that this option only becomes enabled when the above setting is set to <span class="option"><img src="_images/radiobutton.png"> Key animated objects</span> , because it implies that there be a distinction between animated/non-animated objects. Thus, when set to <span class="option">Key all objects</span> , this option is ignored.
        </p>

        <h2><a id="other"></a>Other Options</h2>

        <p>
          Finally, there are a few more functions intended to give you as much control over the script as possible:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="option">Re-Initialize Pickers</span><br>
          <img src="_images/doc_Help.jpg" alt="Help" width="216" height="272" class="docImage"> 
          This function scans the scene for Picker information, i.e. Tabs and Pickers, and updates the UI
          to reflect any changes.<br>
          Usually, there shouldn't be any need for you to manually trigger this function (it is called automatically
          whenever you load, import or reference a scene, <span class="italic">except on Maya 2011</span>), but it is there just in case . However, it can be useful in the case that you accidentally deleted a Picker, or reset the UI etc. While deleting UI elements isn't 
          actually undoable per se, deleting objectSets <span class="italic">is</span>, which is 
          what happens when you delete a tab or Picker. To undo such an action, choose <span class="option">Edit</span><span class="option">Undo</span>, then hit <span class="option">Re-Initialize Pickers</span> to try and recreate any such deleted UI elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="option">Reset UI</span><br>
          This function resets the script to its default settings (MarkingMenu and Display options),
          deletes all and any existing Tabs and Pickers and recreates the UI. You will be presented with a dialog in which you can
          choose what action to perform.<br>
          Note that Tabs and Pickers that originate from References in the current scene can not be
          deleted and will persist until you unload the respective Reference. In that case Reset will not
          create the default, empty 'Pickers' tab; instead, the referenced Tabs and Pickers will take its place.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="option">Help</span><br>
          Opens a window with some information about how to use the script, as well as showing an
          overview of the available Key Modifiers (alt, control, shift) you can use along with
          Pickers in case you can't remember them. Basically a condensed, not-so-pretty version of this document.

        <h1><a id="faq"></a>FAQ</h1>

        <div class="faq">
          <p>
            Here's a list of tips and answers to (what I believe might be) common questions:
          </p>

          <h2 class="question">
            <span class="q">Q:</span> I'm on Maya 2011 and my Pickers don't update when I import/reference a file.
          </h2>
          <p class="answer">
            The scriptJob event to detect import/reference actions was introduced in Maya 2012. If you're using an earlier
            release, you need to manually trigger the update. Go to <img src="_images/cpOptions.png" width="29" height="25" alt="Options"> <span class=" option">Re-Initialize</span>. Now your Picker list 
            should be up to date.
          </p>

           <h2 class="question">
            <span class="q">Q:</span> My GUI was floating on a second monitor. I changed my screen configuration and now the GUI is stuck off-screen. How do I get it back?
          </h2>
          <p class="answer">
            Run the following MEL command in the command line or scriptEditor: <span class="code">aweCPDockWindow();</span>
            <br>This will dock the GUI to the left of your viewport and make it visible
          </p>

          <h2 class="question">
            <span class="q">Q:</span> I referenced a scene containing Pickers. How can I move the Pickers from the referenced scene into my master scene so that they are no longer referenced?
          </h2>
          <p class="answer">
            You can try the following steps:
          </p>
            <ol>
              <li>With the referenced file loaded in your master scene file, go to <img src="_images/cpOptions.png" width="29" height="25" alt="Options"> <span class="option">Save Pickers</span></li>
              <li>Save the file anywhere you want.</li>
              <li>Close the master scene file and open the <span class="italic">referenced file</span> directly</li>
              <li>Save a backup copy of the reference file, then go to <img src="_images/cpOptions.png" width="29" height="25" alt="Options"> <span class="option">Reset</span>. In the dialog that pops up, choose "Reset Pickers".</li>
              <li>Save the reference file and close it.</li>
              <li>Open your master file again and make sure the referenced file is loaded. Go to <img src="_images/cpOptions.png" width="29" height="25" alt="Options"> <span class="option">Load Pickers</span>. Load the file you saved in Step 1.</li>
            </ol>
          <p class="answer">
            If all went well, you should have your Pickers back, except now they shouldn't be referenced. Make sure everything is still working as expected. If so, you can delete the backup you created in Step 4.
          </p>

          <h2 class="question">
            <span class="q">Q:</span> I installed the script and tried to run it, but I'm getting an error and nothing happens.
          </h2>
          <p class="answer">
            Make sure you follow every step in the <a href="#installation" title="Installation">installation instructions</a>. In particular,
            make sure you executed the command <span class="code">source aweControlPicker.mel;</span> after copying the script to your scripts folder.
            This ensures that the file is properly parsed and the settings are initialized. In fact, because settings may be added in updated versions, it is important you run that code <span class="italic">whenever you update the script</span>.

      <div class="section">
        <h1><a id="limitations"></a>Limitations</h1>

        <p>
          There are several currently known limitations of the script:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Due to this script's usage of certain UI elements and functionality, it requires the
            Qt user interface library, which became part of Maya starting from Maya 2011. The script
            most certainly will not work with versions prior to that.
          </li>
          <li>
            The script has been designed to automatically cope with referenced files (and thus,
            referenced Picker data). However, due to how the script relies on objectSets to describe
            said data, it can't delete or modify Pickers that originate from referenced files. This
            imposes limitations on the user regarding such Pickers and tabs. Hence, it is strongly
            recommended that you create all Pickers in the master file in which you will be working
            (after referencing all other files), if you have such privileges.
          </li>
          <li>
            While loading a .CPF will always restore the Picker controls themselves, the
            associated objects will only be restored if they are found at the same absolute DAG path
            they were saved as. If any object specified in the .CPF file doesn't exist, was renamed
            or had its location in the DAG hierarchy changed, it will be excluded from its Picker and
            you will have to manually re-add it.
          </li>
          <li>
            In Maya 2011 there seems to be a glitch with how Maya determines the Panel currently
            under the cursor.<br>
            For the User this means that the MarkingMenu popup behavior can seem erratic and even
            broken. To fix this, the User should try toggling between any two Panel configurations
            (e.g. single Perspective view, switch to Four View, then back to Single Perspective View).
          </li>
          <li>
            The Picker configuration is stored as part of the scene description. If the scene is not saved after 
            creating Pickers, they will be lost when the current scene is closed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Namespace prefixes involving child-namespaces (e.g. :myNamespace:myChildNamespace:myObject) may or 
            may not work. Probably not...
          </li>
          <li>
            A bug in Maya's iconTextButton MEL command causes the -disabledImage flag to be ignored.
            Doesn't break anything, just makes it less pretty
          </li>
          <li>
            A bug in the Autodesk's implementation of the dockControl causes the UI to sometimes not
            remember its current width when its state is changed from Floating to Docked. Also, to be
            able to resize the window vertically after it has been floated, you may have to re-dock
            it and re-float it again first before that is possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            ... and possibly many more I can't think of right now. If you notice something, make sure to tell me!</li>
