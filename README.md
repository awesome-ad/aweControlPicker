# aweControlPicker
aweControlPicker is a minimalistic, clean and versatile GUI Picker for Maya that works with any rig. Sporting a slick interface, easy Picker organisation, no-hassle access to important functions and unique features such as the built-in MarkingMenu, this script will take your workflow to a whole new level of awesomeness!

[Download latest version](https://github.com/awesome-ad/aweControlPicker/releases/download/v1.4/aweControlPicker.zip)
## Installation

Copy the script file (aweControlPicker.mel) to your scripts directory.
Under Windows, this is located under `C:\User\Documents\maya\201x\scripts`
You can determine your user directory from within Maya by executing the following MEL command:

`internalVar -usd;`

Copy the PNG images from the icons folder to your icons directory.
Again, under Windows, this is located under `C:\User\Documents\maya\201x\prefs\icons`
You can determine your icons directory by executing the following command:

`internalVar -ubd;`

After that is done restart Maya and execute the following command:

`source "aweControlPicker.mel";`

To start using the script, create a shelfbutton with the following command:

`aweControlPicker;`

Finally, I've supplied an image called aweControlPicker.png ![icon](https://github.com/awesome-ad/aweControlPicker/blob/master/icons/aweControlPicker.png) that you can use as an icon for your shelfbutton.

That's it!
